DOCBOOK style guide

Version

  Docbook version used is 4.3, as that's the most recent version supported by
  RHEL 4.

Stylesheet

  (HTML) use.id.as.filename=1
  (FO)   index.div.title.properties.space-before.minimum=8pt
           (see Build problems)
  (ALL)  index.on.type=1

nXML

  Needs a schemas.xml file for schema associations

  dbstart.rnc needs to be augmented with elements that it doesn't
  recognize as top level elements. Currently this is just 'glossentry'.

  dbnotn.rnc needs PDF added to recognize PDF as a valid graphics format

The following elements require a unique and readable ID. This will
allow chunked HTML to have rational file names, and allow generation
of individual sections for checking.

Tables shall be in CALS format

  There are numerous known limitations with tables in passivetex, so it is best
  to minimize the use of tables. For table cells, using only the attributes
  referenced where the TeX code is generated (in fotex.sty) seems to have
  helped a lot.

  Tables must specify a fixed width.

  Special support for tables with cell borders is required in the stylesheet.
  

Forth word reference entries

  <glossentry id="store">
  <indexterm role="forth"><primary>!</primary></indexterm>
        <cmdsynopsis>
          <command>!</command>
          <group role="stack">
            <arg>n</arg>
            <arg>a</arg>
            <arg>--</arg>
          </group>
        </cmdsynopsis>

  For words that have different stack effects depending on compilation
  or execution, use cmdsynopsis in a variablelist.

passivetex:

  Math in attributes:
  
    passivetex doesn't like math in FO attributes, and will
    generate an error like:


      l.356 ....minimum="10pt * 0.8" start-indent="0pt">
                                              A</fo:block></fo:block></f...

      !  ==> Fatal error occurred, the output PDF file is not finished!

    This has been resolved in one instance by generating FO output directly

      xmlto fo <file>

    and then searching for the offending string in the FO
    stylesheets. Hopefully, the math will resolve to the default value
    of a parameter, which can then be changed in the stylesheet.
